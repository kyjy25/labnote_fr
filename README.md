# What Is This About

#### What is this about?

Keep track of my thesis project, focused on automating SHG to improve reliability and efficiency in trapped-ion laboratory setups.&#x20;

#### What is SHG?&#x20;

SHG (second-harmonic generation) is a nonlinear optical process used to convert infrared light into UV wavelengths. UV laser light typically offers a narrow frequency bandwidth, high output stability, and well-controlled beam characteristics, all of which are essential for atomic and quantum experiments.

#### Why do we want to automate it?

SHG systems are sensitive to many kinds of drift: temperature fluctuations, pointing instabilities, cavity alignment changes, and variations in input power. These drifts require frequent manual adjustments to maintain efficient frequency conversion. Automation stabilizes long-term UV output, and minimizes the need for human intervention.

#### Have questions/suggestions?

Email: zhen.mi@email.uni-freiburg.de or check github repo [https://github.com/kyjy25/labnote\_fr.git](https://github.com/kyjy25/labnote_fr.git)

#### Why your questions/feedback matter?

It would be not only a help for me, but also a contribution to the lab, the workflow formed could also benefit other people who want to build similar setup (hope so).&#x20;
