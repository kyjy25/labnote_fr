# Introduction

#### What is this about?

Keep track of my thesis project, focused on automating second-harmonic generation to improve reliability and efficiency in trapped-ion laboratory setups.&#x20;

#### Have questions/suggestions?

You can submit issue/suggestions/questions either through synced github repo [https://github.com/kyjy25/labnote\_fr.git](https://github.com/kyjy25/labnote_fr.git), or email: zhen.mi@email.uni-freiburg.de&#x20;

#### Why your questions/feedback matter?

It would be not only a help for me, but also an improvement for the lab, the standard workflow formed will also benefit other people/labs who have demands for building similar setup.&#x20;

#### My lab webpage?
