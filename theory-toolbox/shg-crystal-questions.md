# SHG Crystal Questions

### Why UV SHG requires high birefringence?

For SHG we need:

$$
n(\omega) = n(2\omega)
$$

The refractive index increases as wavelength decreases (normal dispersion)

So in UV:

$$
n(2\omega) \gg n(\omega)
$$

To compensate this mismatch, we need **birefringence** — the ability to choose different refractive indices via polarization:

$$
n_{e}(\theta, 2\omega) = n_{o}(\omega)
$$

If birefringence is weak, we can’t make the indices equal

That is why crystals with **moderate birefringence (LBO, KTP)** cannot phase match many **visible → UV** or **UV → deep UV** conversions. But Crystals with **strong birefringence (BBO, CLBO)** can.

### What is “transparency window”?

Every nonlinear crystal absorbs light at some wavelengths and is transparent at others.

The **transparency window** is the wavelength range where the crystal:

* does not absorb the light strongly
* does not heat up
* does not cause damage
* does not lose SHG efficiency
