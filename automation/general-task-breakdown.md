# General Task Breakdown

### Automation Components Preparation

Identify how many components are missing

* Servo motors
* Pi boards
* Wires \&Leads
* TEC
* DAQ
* Thermistors
* Cables
* Adapters
* Powers, Power Strips
* ...

Identify their corresponding properties and expected performances we need

For servos, analyze how many motional DOF are there in the cavity to determine the amount of servos we need.

Purchase selection, taking into account their delivery time. Place orders.

### Components Test & Benchmark

Servo benchmark, including hysteresis determination

Soldering work, including Pi boards (Maybe send to electrical workshop)

### Artiq Integration

Practically connect them into Artiq network, test their performance and compatibility

Make Artiq system actually take over the automation work

### 3D Print

Identify how many different 3D printings we need.

Measure their geometry, make 3D models and print.

Assembly test and revision printing

### Assembly, Optical Alignment

### Software \&Program

Automation program test

Test reliability and quality of automated SHG&#x20;
