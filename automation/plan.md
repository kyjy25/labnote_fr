# Plan

### Oven Heating Test (Short term)

Glue cleaning test

Gluing thermistors onto oven (should we use the old positions?)

Measure temperature reading stability and gradient within the oven

Put the oven into cavity, along with other components of BBO cavity, test thermal compatibility.

### Artiq Integration (Middle/Long term)

List out what devices are required for SHG of BBO setup.

Check all of their divers, like&#x20;

* PZT driver
* Photodiode readout (via DAQ?)

Practically connect them into Artiq network, test their performance and compatibility

Make Artiq system actually take over the measurement work not locally on laptop.

### Assembly and See the UV light (Middle/Long term)

Cleaning work

Assembly

Mode Matching Test

Cavity Stability Test

SHG Conversion Efficiency and Output Power Test

Output Quality (Frequency and power stability?)

### Automation Work (Long Term)
